# Pneumonia-Highlighter
Pneumonia Highlighter code - a deep learning model based on the NIH chest xray dataset.
This model predicts the presence or absence of pneumonia from a frontal radiogram. 
No lateral radiograms are included in the dataset.  
The Ground truth = radiologists' readings of each frontal (AP or PA) CXR in the dataset.
EDA file - for exploratory data analysis.
Train-buildVersion2 for building the model with keras.
Inference1 file for prediction of new xrays.
